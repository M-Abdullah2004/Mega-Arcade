# Mega-Arcade
This project, developed by a team of six colleagues including myself, is a compilation of classic arcade games programmed in C language. Featuring Snake, Pacman, Hangman, and a Maze Game, each game boasts colorful graphics and smooth gameplay, thanks to our implementation of error handling techniques.
